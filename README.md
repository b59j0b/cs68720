Due:   11:59PM, Tuesday, February   11, 2025
Note: There are 5 problems with   10 points maximum. All homework must   be   edited   using   a   word processor, and   submitted via myCourses.
Please include a cover page with your full names (group info),   course title, problem   set number,   and   your submission date. You will automatically lose   1 point if   the cover   page   is   missing.
Problem   1-1.          Parallel   Computations   (1+0.5point)
Andrews, Exercise   1.13 (a) and   (c) only, page   37.
Note: Develop the pseudo code like the worker processes demonstrated on page   16 of   your textbook.
Problem   1-2.          Atomic   Actions   and   Histories   (2+0.5 points)
Andrews, Exercise   2.   10 (a) and   (b), page   84.
Andrews, Exercise   2.   12 (a) only, page   84.
Note: (1) For   Exercise   2.10 (b), the   assignment   y   =   y – x   is   implemented   by   4   atomic   actions.   (2)   For   both exercises   2.10  2.12, you   should   give   at   least   one   scenario   for   each   set   of   final   values   of   x   andy.
Problem   1-3.          At-Most-Once   Property   (2 points)
Andrews, Exercise   2.14 (a) and   (b), page   85.
Correction: Question (a) should as代 写CIS 481: Parallel & Distributed Software Systems Homework #1Java
代做程序编程语言k “Do   the   assignments   in   the   co-statement   meet   the   requirements   of   the   At-Most-Once   Property   (2.2)? Explain.”
Problem   1-4.          Await   Statement   (1.5+1 points)
Andrews, Exercise   2.13 (a), (b),   and   (c), page   85.
Andrews, Exercise   2.18, page   86.
Note: A   scheduling policy is weakly   fair, if every   await   statement that is   eligible   to   be   executed   next   will   be executed eventually, assuming that its condition once becomes true   and   then remains   true.
Problem   1-5.          Programming   Assignment   (1.5 points)
Implement your   parallel algorithm for Andrews, Exercise 1.13 (a) in Java. Use threads to simulate   multiple worker processes for parallel computation.
Sample code for using multiple threads in Java can be downloaded   from:

General   Remarks:
1.       Always provide your reasoning/explanations, and not   only your   final   answers.
2.       You may   discuss   assigned   problems   with   your   classmates,   but   you   must   individually   write   your   own   solutions/code for all assignments.
3.       Assignments are to be   submitted via   myCourses by   the   due   date.
